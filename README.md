Password Strength Checker

Overview:
This project is a Python-based password strength checker that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various criteria.

Development Process:
I decided to follow a YouTube tutorial to guide me through the development of this project, which helped me understand the key concepts and functionalities needed for a password strength checker. I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment, which provided a convenient interface for writing and testing my code.

Challenges:
While working on this project, I struggled with using GitHub to upload my work. Navigating the platform was initially challenging, but I have watched numerous tutorials to improve my understanding. I am committed to continuing this project and refining my skills until I perfect both the password strength checker and my GitHub usage.

Any feedback would be really appreciated :)
